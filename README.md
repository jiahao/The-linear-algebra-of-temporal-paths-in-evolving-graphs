**Abstract**: Evolving graphs arise in many different contexts
 where the interrelations between data elements change over
 time. We present a breadth first search (BFS) algorithm for
 evolving graphs that can track (active) nodes correctly. Using
 simple examples, we show that na√Øve matrix-matrix multiplication
 on time-dependent adjacency matrices miscounts the number
 of temporal paths. By mapping an evolving graph to an
 adjacency matrix of the equivalent static graph, we prove
 the properties of the BFS algorithm using the properties of
 the adjacency matrix. Finally, demonstrate how the BFS over
 evolving graphs can be applied to mining citation networks.
